HelpMe is a safety app to be used in emergency situations. It will send a message to the user's close contacts telling them where the user is and also sending a preset general message typed by the user beforehand. It will also send a video clip of what is happening to the user's contacts to give them an idea about what situation they are in. By clicking a couple buttons the user will be able to notify close friends and family during an emergency situation where they do not have much time to alert anybody else.
